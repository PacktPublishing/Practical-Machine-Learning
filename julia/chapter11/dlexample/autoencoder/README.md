# Deep Learning with Julia

## The tutorial
The "Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning" tutorial can be found [here](http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLD_TUTORIAL). The tutorial provides a fair amount of starter code in Matlab, which also contains the data we need to follow along with Julia. If you just want the data, you can use the shell scripts provided in this repository which have the form **getdata-*.sh**. Just fill in the name of the exercise you're working on.

## Julia scripts
The scripts included are complete solutions; they are NOT starter code. I'm still working through the tutorial. But once I'm done, and have learned quite a bit more about Julia, I will include a directory with just starter code.
