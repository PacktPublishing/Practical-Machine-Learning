**Tackle the real-world complexities of modern machine learning with innovative and cutting-edge techniques**

## What is this book about?
This book explores an extensive range of machine learning techniques uncovering hidden tricks and tips for several types of data using practical and real-world examples. While machine learning can be highly theoretical, this book offers a refreshing hands-on approach without losing sight of the underlying principles. Inside, a full exploration of the various algorithms gives you high-quality guidance so you can begin to see just how effective machine learning is at tackling contemporary challenges of big data.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Implement a wide range of algorithms and techniques for tackling complex data 
* Get to grips with some of the most powerful languages in data science, including R, Python, and Julia 
* Harness the capabilities of Spark and Hadoop to manage and process data successfully 
* Apply the appropriate machine learning technique to address real-world problems 
* Get acquainted with Deep learning and find out how neural networks are being used at the cutting-edge of machine learning 
* Explore the future of machine learning and dive deeper into polyglot persistence, semantic data, and more

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
using PyPlot
x = linspace(-2pi, 2pi)
y = sin(x)
plot(x, y, "--b")
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book has been created for data scientists who want to see machine learning in action and explore its real-world application. With guidance on everything from the fundamentals of machine learning and predictive analytics to the latest innovations set to lead the big data revolution into the future, this is an unmissable resource for anyone dedicated to tackling current big data challenges. Knowledge of programming (Python and R) and mathematics is advisable if you want to get started immediately.
