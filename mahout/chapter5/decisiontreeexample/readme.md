Please refer to the RandomForest implementation as a reference. The DecisionFOrest API is used for this purpose, but with the following specific implementation lines..

int numberOfTrees = 1;
Data data = loadData(...);
DecisionForest forest = buildForest(numberOfTrees, data);
 
String path = "saved-trees/" + numberOfTrees + "-trees.txt";
DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(path));
 
forest.write(dos);
